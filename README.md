# Employee Management System

A modern Employee Management System built with a React (Vite) frontend and Node.js/Express backend, designed to help organizations manage employee records, leave, and user access.

---

## Features

- **Employee Dashboard**: View, search, and manage employee details in a responsive table and card layout.
- **Employee Registration**: Register new employees (by admin/superuser) and allow self-signup for new users.
- **Employee Profile Editing**: Update employee information, including image uploads with validation (JPEG/PNG, under 2MB).
- **Leave Management**: Track employee leave, view who is currently on leave, and manage leave requests (pending approval for admins).
- **Authentication & Authorization**: API endpoints secured with JWT; user roles supported (superuser/admin vs standard employee).
- **Notifications**: Real-time toast notifications for actions, errors, and status updates.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Bootstrap and custom styling for a professional dashboard experience.
- **API Integration**: Uses Axios for client-server communication.
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Both client and server-side validation with user-friendly error messages.
